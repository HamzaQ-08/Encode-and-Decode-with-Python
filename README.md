# Encode and Decode Program

This Python program provides a simple interface to encode and decode messages. The user can choose to encode a message, decode a message, or quit the program. The encoding and decoding processes are based on specific patterns defined within the program.

## Features

### Encoding Messages
- The user can enter a message to encode.
- If the length of the message is greater than 3, it performs a series of transformations on the message.
- If the length of the message is 3 or less, it reverses the message and concatenates some of its characters in a specific way.

### Decoding Messages
- The user can enter a message to decode.
- If the length of the message is greater than 5, it attempts to reverse the encoding pattern.
- If the length of the message is 5 or less, it performs a simple transformation to attempt to decode the message.

### Quit Option
- The user can choose to quit the program.

## How to Use

1. **Run the program.**
2. **You will be prompted with three options:**
   - Type `1` to encode a message.
   - Type `2` to decode a message.
   - Type `quit` or `0` to exit the program.

### Encoding a Message
1. Select the encoding option by typing `1`.
2. Enter the message you wish to encode.
3. The program will process the message and display the encoded result.

### Decoding a Message
1. Select the decoding option by typing `2`.
2. Enter the message you wish to decode.
3. The program will process the message and display the decoded result.

### Quitting the Program
1. To quit the program, type `quit` or `0`.
2. The program will display a thank you message and terminate.

## Error Handling
The program includes basic error handling to catch any invalid inputs and display an appropriate message.
